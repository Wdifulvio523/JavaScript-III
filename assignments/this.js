/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Binding - Kind of like the default. "this" is bound to the window/console. We may not actually want to do this.
* 2. Implicit Binding - The function called by the preceeding dot is what "this" is linked to. This is most common.
* 3. Explicit Binding - using .call .apply and .bind -- .apply does much of the same as .call and iterates through arrays -- .bind creates a new function
* 4. New Binding - Using a constructor function. Refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
